                    <h2>The Post-Impressionist Pioneer</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vincent van Gogh is considered one of the greatest Post-Impressionists. His work had a powerful
                        influence on the development of modern painting, particularly on the Expressionist movement in
                        early 20th-century art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His bold use of color, expressive brushwork, and contoured forms were revolutionary. Unlike the
                        Impressionists, who focused on light and atmospheric effects, Van Gogh used color and line to
                        express emotion and his inner state.

                    <h2>Influence on Expressionism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Artists like Edvard Munch and the German Expressionists were deeply inspired by Van Gogh's
                        ability to convey raw human emotion. His "Starry Night" is often cited as a precursor to
                        Expressionism, where the subjective experience takes precedence over objective reality.

                    <p>
                        Today, Van Gogh is a universal cultural icon. His life story—the "tortured artist"—has become as
                        famous as his work. Museums dedicated to his art, especially the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,
                        attract millions of visitors annually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His paintings are among the most expensive ever sold, a stark contrast to his life of poverty
                        where he sold only one painting.
